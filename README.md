# scrape_geoguessr

A simple R-script to read the highscores on Geoguesser challenges.
The scraper uses Rselenium to navigate to challenge URL's read from a .csv file
Currently only works for regular challenges and does not work for country streaks

The geoguessr account used to scrape challenge highscores must have completed these challenges.

I made this because running a geoguessr competition gets tiresome fast if you need to manually type down all scores.
